benefit2: Mold Control
benefit2_desc: Spray foam insulation helps to keep surface temperatures regulated, thereby minimizing the potential for condensation. Additionally, the air barrier properties can help minimize the movement of moisture-laden air within the building envelope and associated moisture problems.

benefit3: Sound Proofing
benefit3_desc: "Sprayed polyurethane foam as a sound-deadening measure works for essentially the same reason the material works for mitigating airflow: sound is airborne. By filling wall voids, the foam curbs resonance, keeping the sound from leaving or entering the desired room or space."
